# Networking

Most of the networking in kubernetes is handled by the chosen network procider and does not require much user imput.
There are a number of [network options to choose from](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/), though this workshop will not be going into the different types. Take the time to explore the different options and choose which one is best for your cluster. Note that some managed clusters only allow limited networking options.
