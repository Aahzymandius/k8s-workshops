# Hands-on workshops for GKE

These are a series of hands-on workshops designed to get familiar with some of the basic features and functionality of GKE and k8s.

If you don't already have a cluster, try using [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/#interacting-with-your-cluster) or an online kubernetes playground.

# Feedback

For anyone following this workshop, please feel free to submit any issues you run into, or suggest material to cover and I'll gladly address them. With regular releases of k8s some of the demos and hands on will break
